### 2. **Focus**

- During core collaboration hours, team members should minimize distractions and focus on assigned tasks.
### 3. **Openness**
- Progress will be shared openly during stand-ups, especially blockers that require team support.
- Transparent communication is encouraged, whether it's about issues, delays, or new ideas.
- All feedback is valuable. We will create an environment where all ideas and perspectives are heard and respected.
### 4. **Respect**

- Ensure all voices are heard during meetings, promoting inclusivity and collaboration.
### 5. **Courage**

## Working Hours
- **Core Hours:** 4 PM - 10 PM (team members are expected to be available for collaboration).
- **Flexible Hours:** Outside core hours, team members may work at their convenience but must ensure sprint commitments are met.
## Communication Guidelines
- **Primary Tool:** Slack (for daily updates, queries, and informal communication).
- **Project Management:** Tasks and progress will be tracked using Jira.
- **Email:** Used for formal communication with external stakeholders (e.g., client).
- **Video Conferencing:** Slack Huddle for team meetings and daily stand-ups, Zoom for client meetings.
### Communication Expectations:
- **Slack:** Respond within 2 hours during core working hours.
- **Email:** Respond within 1 business day.
- **Stand-ups:** Attend daily at 10:00 AM CST, sharing progress, blockers, and plans for the day.
## Meetings

- **Client Meeting:** Thursdays, 4 PM - 5 PM via Zoom. Prepare key updates and questions in advance.
- **Sprint Review & Retrospective:** End of each sprint, typically on Fridays, 3 PM - 6 PM. Review what went well, and what didn't, and identify action points for improvement.
## Definition of Completion
- All tasks must meet the acceptance criteria outlined in the user story.
- Code must be reviewed and merged into the main branch, with relevant documentation updated.
- Feature deployment must be tested in the staging environment before presenting to the client.
## Tools and Resources
- **Code Repository:** GitHub (all code changes should follow GitFlow and include peer code reviews).
- **Deployed Application:** Regular updates are required to ensure the app reflects the current progress.
- **Project Management Tool:** Jira is used to track tasks, story points, and overall progress.
## Collaboration Practices
- Pair programming or team collaboration is encouraged for complex tasks.

- If you encounter a blocker, communicate it early and seek assistance from team members or the Scrum Master.
## Risk and Escalation
- For unexpected risks or delays, promptly communicate with the Scrum Master or Product Owner.
- If a risk may affect delivery, it will be discussed during the next stand-up or relevant meeting.
## Client Feedback Process
- Feedback from the client, Dr. Ritchey, will be reviewed and incorporated into our sprint planning.
- Action points from the client meeting will be documented and shared with the team via Jira or Slack.
## Revisiting the Agreement
